# Credit-Risk-Classification-Logistic-Regression-SVM-and-Deeplearning
In this notebook we apply the Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and Multilayer Perceptron algorithms to classify the credit risk of the credit database: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset. The problem consists in the classification of the clients as 'high risk' or 'low risk' to take a loan.
